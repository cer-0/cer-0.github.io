This is the part where you get to know me... Sort of (I'll skip the obvious part).

Apart from computers, \*nix-like operating systems, computer security, privacy, free and open source software I enjoy cycling, swimming, reading (novels, most of the time), playing video games and listening to a lot of music (mostly extreme metal).

I'm a CpE undergrad, after spending roughly 3 years in a career I thought I liked (looking at you actuarial science) I decided to switch to computer engineering, so, here I am. (:

Kudos to [4rtur8](https://www.4rtur8.com/), who made this possible (I am so terrible at web development).
