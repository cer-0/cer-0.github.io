This is the part where you get to know me... Sort of (I'll skip the obvious part).


Apart from computers, \*nix-like operating systems, computer security, privacy, free and open source software I enjoy cycling, swimming, reading (novels, most of the time), playing video games and listening to music (mostly extreme metal).


I'm a cpe undergrad, after spending roughly 3 years in a career I thought I liked (looking at you actuarial science) I decided to switch to computer engineering, so, here I am. (:


Kudos to @TRMIKO, who made this possible (I suck so much at web development).
