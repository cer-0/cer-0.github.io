Quick reminder of how to set up a personal blog using github pages.

## Requirements

- git
- ruby (optional, if you want to use Jekyll)
- a github account?

## Setting up everything

First, create a new repo, make sure you name it `username.github.io`, in my case I named it `cer-0.github.io`. I recommend you to _do not Initialize the repo with a README_ file. Next, clone the repo to your projects folder and `cd` into it.

_Note_: You can do a `git clone url.git blog` so the repo will be saved as `blog` instead of `username.github.io`.

Let's keep it simple and stupid. Now add some content to your new website

---
```sh
echo "Hello World!" > index.html
```
---

Next steps, add the files, commit and push to master.

---
```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "First commit, adding index.html"
git push origin master
```
---

In theory, you should now be able to see content in `username.github.io`. You can try to `curl`it, in my case:

---
```sh
curl https://cer-0.github.io
```
---

Well, that's kinda everything if you want to create your own website. If not, you can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but, we'll need to do a couple more steps.

Make sure you have `ruby` [installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), since we'll need a couple of gems.

_Note_: Check out the [Ruby ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ruby) if you're using Arch, since you'll need to modify your `PATH` in order to execute gems, also, I recomend you to configure the `bundler` path.

---
```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```
---

Now (assuming you're still in your blog directory), we need to tell Jekyll to create a new site...

---
```sh
jekyll new . --force
```
---

_Note_: `--force` it's due to the `index.html` file.

Now we just need to build the site and test it works (you can remove the `index.html` file now):

---
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
---

You should see a lot of output and the last lines should be something like this...

---
```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
---

Open the URL in your browser and see if it worked. Well, it should be up and running. Yay!. You can add, commit and push to master if  you want to.

_Note_: Sometimes when you go to your hosted page you can't see the changes inmediatly, so __try reloading the page without cache!__ (`shift+control+r` on `firefox`).

I recommend you to have a look at [this documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/), so you get familiar with the site structure!.

Now, the stock theme it's neat, but, it burns my eyes, so, we'll be changing it. The first thing we need to know it's _what theme are we gonna install?_, you can find a lot of themes in [jekyll's page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). For this blog we used [b2a3e8's theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

Github Pages supports a lot of Jekyll themes, so, if you find one you like, head over to the repo and look up for the installation process, most of them should have a line like this...

---
```yaml
remote_theme: b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console
```
---

We just need to replace the `theme: minima` line (inside `_config.yaml`) by the line above. Next, add, commit and push!. If everything it's correct you should now see your site with a new theme!. 

From here you can start playing around with the structure and content, check [this documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) if you feel lost.

So, that's pretty much all. Hope it helps.
