title: 0x2 Full Disk Encryption Installation on Arch Linux
layout: page
---

A couple of years ago someone introduced me to Full Disk Encryption (FDE) with [Pavel Kogan's guide](https://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/). A few things have changed since then. So, here I try to complement Pavel's post.

## Partitioning the device

We'll be using LUKS + LVM. Yo can check the [ArchWiki documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS) for more information.

```sh
parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 2048s 100%
# Read the notes below #
cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks1 /dev/sda1
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 lvmarch
pvcreate /dev/mapper/lvmarch
vgcreate varch /dev/mapper/lvmarch
lvcreate -L 1G varch -n swap
lvcreate -L 30G varch -n root
lvcreate -l +100%FREE varch -n home
mkswap -L swap /dev/mapper/varch-swap
swapon /dev/mapper/varch-swap
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/varch-root
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/varch-home
mount /dev/mapper/varch-root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/mapper/varch-home /mnt/home
```

> GRUB [recently added support for LUKS2 devices](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/commit/?id=365e0cc3e7e44151c14dd29514c2f870b49f9755), (check [55093](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55093)), I haven't tested it yet, so, for the moment we'll be sticking with LUKS1. Expect an update soon though.

## Installing Arch

Some things have changed, now we need to manually install the `lvm2` module, the firmware and a text editor of your choice. Here we install the `linux-hardened` kernel, check the [ArchWiki kernel page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel) for supported kernels.

```sh
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux-hardened linux-firmware lvm2 grub vim
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt
```
## Avoid entering password twice

When we turn on the computer, we'll be prompted for entering the disk's password twice (once in GRUB startup and once more when initramfs mounts the partitions), in order to avoid this we need to create an alternative method for unlocking the LUKS device, in this case we will use a _key file_, first we create it and next we add this file as a valid key for our block device.

```sh
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/crypto_keyfile.bin
cryptseupt luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin
```

> `chmod 000 /crypto_keyfile.bin`, just to make sure. (:

## Setting up `mkinitcpio`

The first step to generate a valid initramfs it's to configure `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` accordingly to our encryption scheme. We must add a couple of modules to the configuration file, so they will be included with `initramfs` and hence be used, also, we need to include the keyfile, so it will be used to open the LUKS device via `ecrypt` hook.

```
# FILES
# This setting is similar to BINARIES above, however, files are added
# as-is and are not parsed in any way.  This is useful for config files.
FILES=/crypto_keyfile.bin

# HOOKS
# This is the most important setting in this file.  The HOOKS control the
# modules and scripts added to the image, and what happens at boot time.
# Order is important, and it is recommended that you do not change the
# order in which HOOKS are added.  Run 'mkinitcpio -H <hook name>' for
# help on a given hook.
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard fsck lvm2 encrypt)
```

Now make sure you re-generate the `initramfs` running `mkinitcpio -p KERNEL`, in this case:

```sh
mkinitcpio -p linux-hardened
```

## Configuring `GRUB`

Since we have `/boot` encrypted we need to enable GRUB's encryption feature in it's configuration file (`/etc/default/grub`), and set the [`encrypt` hook](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/System_configuration#Using_encrypt_hook).

```
# GRUB boot loader configuration
...
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=/dev/sda1:lvmarch"

# Uncomment to enable booting from LUKS encrypted devices
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
```

Finally, just install and generate the configuration file of GRUB.

```sh
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
grub-install /dev/sda
```

That's it. Exit the `chroot` and reboot. You should see a message asking for the passphrase of the LUKS device.

> Note: The keyboard layout it's set to English (US).

## Considerations

Encrypting your device it's not a complete attack-proof solution, remember, this will protect your information IF someone tries to access when the device it's off. You're still vulnerable to [cool boot attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack), and to someone getting your information trough internet or social engineering IF the device it's on, so keep that in mind.
